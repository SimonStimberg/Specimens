SPECIMENS is an interactive audio-visual installation consisting of four analog CRT televisions, each representing a specimen of abstract organisms that are rendered through basic visual and musical elements. As the organisms communicate with each other, they synchronize their movements and eventually establish a harmonic state of equilibrium. Audience interaction stimulates the crittersâ€™ behavior, but also leads to a disruption of the fragile ecosystem, while too much human interference will eventually cause the system to collapse. Key motivation for the work was a critical examination of our relationship towards technology and nature, while we latently succumb to the illusion of machines having an autonomous life. This led to the concept of infusing raw technology with organic and lifelike behavior by repurposing obsolete analog displays with generative digital algorithms.
